    <h2>Easy Homemade Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is the perfect trifecta of ingredients: pasta, tomatoes, and cheese. Or, more specifically, the three main components of a classic lasagna are a red meat sauce, lasagna noodles, and a mix of ricotta and other cheeses. You can swap out any of these three components to make different styles of lasagna (white lasagna, vegetarian lasagna, spinach lasagna, etc.) but the recipe we have for you today is a classic lasagna with a tomato-based meat sauce, ricotta cheese blend, and lasagna noodles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Italian Sausage</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauce first (this keeps the noodles from sticking to the bottom of the dish)</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Cheese (it’s easier to spread the cheese on top of the solid noodles than on the sauce)</li>
        <li>Repeat: sauce – noodles – cheese two more times</li>
        <li>Finish with sauce and more cheese</li>
    </ol>
